		<p><strong>The Idaho Rocky Mountain Ranch is a unique setting for weddings, retreats and private gatherings, whether you choose to make the Ranch your own with an exclusive occupancy or host a private Meadow Site party. The Ranch is recommended by Martha Stewart Weddings as an outstanding destination wedding venue.</strong></p>

		<h4>Make the Ranch Your Own: Exclusive Occupancy Events</h4>
		<p>You may host a one or multi-day event as the Ranch's exclusive guests. The intimacy of a private Ranch reservation creates a unique and ideal atmosphere for a wedding, family reunion, recreational adventure, business retreat, or relaxed enjoyment of friends. Surrounded by the spectacular Sawtooth and White Cloud Mountains, with the privacy an exclusive reservation provides, you may customize meals and activities to enjoy the Ranch in your own way and time. The historic Lodge and Cabins' fine accommodations, our chef's excellent cuisine, our hot springs pool, fishing pond, and scenic 900 acres are yours exclusively for the duration of your stay. The Ranch can accommodate 44-50 of your guests, for one or many days.</p>
		
		<p>Our chef will fashion menus tailored to your tastes and preferences, from the ultimate picnic or barbecue to more elegant fare. Vegetarian and childrenâ€™s options always are available, and we can accommodate special diets with advance notice.</p>

		<h4>Meadow Site Parties</h4>
		<p>Our rustic Meadow Site is a truly unique venue for your private gathering, providing canopied rough-hewn log tables nestled among lodge pole pines, the soothing sounds of adjacent Gold Creek and a magnificent Sawtooth Mountains background. Our chef's fine cuisine, and your guests, creates a perfect event.</p>
		<p>The Meadow Site is available for your wedding, reunion, business or special occasion during our summer season, June through September. For a real western flair, Pioneer Outfitters Percheron horse drawn wagon may be contracted to provide your guests a scenic ride, or for transport from the parking area.</p>
		<p>We would be happy to reserve rooms for guests attending your Meadow Site event, subject to availability and our group reservation policies.</p>
		<p>Please <a href="contact.php">contact us</a> for any additional information, or to plan your exclusive occupancy, private party or group event at the Ranch.</p>
