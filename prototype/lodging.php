		<p><strong>The Idaho Rocky Mountain Ranch cabins and lodge rooms are charming and comfortable, with private baths with either stone showers or deep, relaxing bathtubs.</strong></p>
		
		<p>Fourteen cabins, our Family Cabin, the Honeymoon Cabin and four lodge rooms provide you a home away from home in which to relax and prepare for your next adventure. And there are no phones, televisions or radios in the accommodations allowing you to truly unplug.</p>

			<h4>Cabins</h4>
			<p>Each cabin is well appointed with upgraded (and raved about!) beds and bedding, a rock fireplace, electric heat, private bath and bed(s) for two, either twin beds or a king. A third person can be accommodated on a rollaway bed. Our Cabins are arranged in seven two-cabin duplexes. Four duplexes offer interior connecting doors between the two cabins, to comfortably accommodate families of 4 to 6 people.</p>

			<p>Our Deluxe Family Cabin, for larger families, includes two cabins, each with king bed, and a third room with twin beds. The Deluxe Honeymoon Cabin, with king bed, stands alone. </p>
