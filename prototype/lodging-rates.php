		<p><strong>The Idaho Rocky Mountain Ranch cabins and lodge rooms are charming and comfortable, with private baths with either stone showers or deep, relaxing bathtubs.</strong></p>
		
		<p>Fourteen cabins, our Family Cabin, the Honeymoon Cabin and four lodge rooms provide you a home away from home in which to relax and prepare for your next adventure. And there are no phones, televisions or radios in the accommodations allowing you to truly unplug.</p>

		<h4>2014 Summer Season, June 13th through September 13th</h4>
