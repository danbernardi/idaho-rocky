Paul had been introduced to the area by Dave Williams, namesake of Williams Peak, an early Stanley basin rancher and sometime postmaster, fishing and hunting guide. Paul commissioned architect Ellis Bjorling to design the Idaho Rocky Mountain Club, and a crew of 50-60 men began construction in the fall of 1929, snaking timber down nearby Williams and Gold Creeks and hauling it to the site by horse and wagon.\r\n<img class=\"floatimg\" src=\"http://irmr.zendentest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/history.jpg\" alt=\"Idaho Rocky Mountain Ranch History\" />\r\n<h4>Grand Opening</h4>\r\n<strong>The Idaho Rocky Mountain Club opened to guests June 25, 1930 with the completion of the main lodge</strong>, nine guest cabins, a hydroelectric plant, fishpond, and hot springs pool.

From 1952-1977 Bogert raised award-winning hay and the Rokmor herd, and in 1977 his daughter, Rozalys Smith, reopened the IRMR as a guest ranch. <strong>Current owners Courtney and Steve Kapp and Diana Kapp and David Singer purchased the Ranch in 2005.</strong>\r\n\r\nPreservation of the Ranch’s history and architecture was paramount as the Kapp-Singer family upgraded Ranch facilities for guest comfort.

And you’ll raft through Indian Riffles, the historic Chinook Salmon spawning grounds, part of the longest salmon migration in the world – almost 1000 miles from source to sea.\r\n \r\nThe Payette River offers exhilarating Class II-IV rapids throughout the summer.

The Pioneer Cabin in Stanley Park, the Doc Day Cabin, Indian Rock Shelter at Redfish Lake and Pole Creek Ranger Station also provide a glimpse of the area’s history.\r\n*The Sawtooth Fish Hatchery conducts guided tours daily – a fascinating look at the work they do, and the historic and contemporary importance of salmon to our region.\r\n*A walking tour of Stanley allows you to take in the amazing views as you stroll through visiting points of historic interest, as well as our town’s current shops and offerings. \r\n* There are several natural hot springs close by whose locatios the locals like to guard zealously, but nature gives them away!  As you drive and stroll, keep on the lookout for rising steam. \r\n* Redfish Lake is our local “mountain beach scene” for swimming, kayaking, paddle or motor boating, and good old fashioned sand play\r\nMuseums and Ghost Towns\r\nFollow the Salmon River north to the historic Sunbeam bathhouse and hot springs, to the Yankee Fork and  Sunbeam Dam, and beyond to ghost towns Bonanza and Custer and the Yankee Fork Dredge for a keen look into the history of the region, and a sense of the rugged individuals who settled it. Closer to the Ranch Sawtooth City and Vienna, though unrestored, stand as similar testament.\r\nIf you venture further on the old stagecoach road, The Custer Motorway Adventure Road, to Challis, be sure to stop at the Land of the Yankee Fork Interpretive Center and Bayhorse on your way back to the Ranch.\r\nScenic Drives\r\nEven the shortest drive provides incomparable views and photo opportunities, but there are several we highly recommend if you choose to road-trip in the Valley. Basin Butte Lookout, Cape Horn Guard Station Loop, the Dagger Falls-Decker Flat Road (FS Road 210), a trip to Galena Summit and the Headwaters of the Salmon River, Kelly Creek Road, Nip and Tuck Road, Pole Creek Lookout, and Valley Road all provide magnificent scenery, and a chance to view local wildlife.  There also are three designated scenic byways through the valley:  the Ponderosa Pine, Salmon River and Sawtooth.\r\nWalking Tours\r\nIn addition to a stroll through Stanley, a walk though Sun Valley, Ketchum, Hailey and Challis provides more history – and shopping.  And while in Sun Valley, a visit to the outdoor ice skating rink, for watching or skating, provides a novel summer pleasure.\r\n \r\nLINK to the Area Recreation and Exploration doc, posted on basecamp, files, title Area Recreation and Exploration\r\n', 'Area Attractions', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '57-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-03-23 18:46:39', '2015-03-23 18:46:39', '', '57', 'http://irmr.zendentest.com/57-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

His sensibilities arise from a mix of fine culinary and wine training, and his rugged upbringing in Gig Harbor, WA. Since he could walk, Jordan has been a tried and true outdoor enthusiast, with a love of backcountry skiing, golf and wakeboarding. When not up to his elbows applying a meat rub or preparing a Kecap Manis-Lime Glaze in the  Ranch kitchen, you’ll find him out exploring the magnificent Sawtooth Mountains with his beautiful wife, Stephanie and daughter, Olivia (favorite food: mac & cheese) and black lab, Jake. Jordan developed a love of cooking learning from his grandmother. He earned his food and wine degrees from the Art Institute of Colorado, Denver, in 2003.

Paul had been introduced to the area by Dave Williams, namesake of Williams Peak, an early Stanley basin rancher and sometime postmaster, fishing and hunting guide. Paul commissioned architect Ellis Bjorling to design the Idaho Rocky Mountain Club, and a crew of 50-60 men began construction in the fall of 1929, snaking timber down nearby Williams and Gold Creeks and hauling it to the site by horse and wagon.\r\n\r\nThe Idaho Rocky Mountain Club opened to guests June 25, 1930 with the completion of the main lodge, nine guest cabins, a hydroelectric plant, fishpond, and hot springs pool.  In 1994 the Idaho Rocky Mountain Ranch was added to the National Register of Historic Places as an example of the architecture of the period. \r\n\r\n<em>Dude Ranches Out West</em>, a vacation catalogue from 1937 published by the Union Pacific Railroad, described the Idaho Rocky Mountain Club: “All the buildings are constructed of logs, finished luxuriously within and containing unusual architectural and interior ….. novelties which fit into the general atmosphere of the ranch. The club has its own modern hydroelectric plant and an artificial lake stocked with trout. The club is the pioneer in its field with a wondrous wealth of material on which [it can] build.” \r\n\r\nIn 1942 Paul sold the Ranch to Austrian clothing manufacturer and skiing enthusiast Joseph Lanz, who in 1952 sold to Edmund Bogert, Pocatello, Idaho automobile dealer.  From 1952-1977 Bogert raised award-winning hay and the Rokmor herd, and in 1977 his daughter, Rozalys Smith, reopened the IRMR as a guest ranch.

For employees choosing to live off campus, $5 per day for shift meal/s will be charged on days worked. Room and board is a combined package; there is not a separate package for room or board.

Lunch generally is a make-your-own sandwich or other buffet. Crew dinner is served 7 nights a week between 5:00 – 5:45pm. There is a refrigerator for crew use that often has tasty leftovers designated for you.\r\n\r\nIf you will be camping on your days off, the chef will let you know the food available to pack and take with you. \r\n\r\nWe do our best to provide all employees with nutritious meals.

There is limited space available in the crew refrigerator for food purchased for your personal use. \r\n\r\n<h4>Location, Climate & Transportation</h4>\r\nOur 900 acre ranch is located in the heart of the Sawtooth National Recreation Area, 9 miles south of Stanley on Highway 75 between mile markers 180 and 181. The ranch is 50 miles north of Sun Valley, 130 miles east of Boise and 125 miles north of Twin Falls, Idaho.\r\n\r\nStanley is a small town where you may purchase most necessities. Challis or Ketchum/Sun Valley, which are an hour to an hour and a half drive from the ranch, are the closest larger shopping areas.\r\n\r\nThe altitude here at the ranch is 6,600 feet. We can have lovely, hot summer days into the 80s in August, but on average have only 30 frost-free nights a year. Please be prepared for cold mornings and evenings, as well as our warmer days. \r\n\r\nThere is no public transportation to or within Stanley and the Sawtooth National Recreation Area.  The closest airport is Sun Valley; the closest major airport is Boise. Sun Valley Express (www.sunvalleyexpress.com) has daily service from the Boise airport to various locations in Ketchum/Sun Valley, from which we can assist with transportation. \r\n\r\nWe strongly recommend that you have some form of transportation – auto or bicycle – so that you may fully enjoy the area. \r\n\r\n<h4>Recreational Opportunities</h4>\r\nOn the ranch you may enjoy the ranch’s natural hot springs swimming pool, stocked catch-and-release fishing pond with paddleboat, the Salmon River running through the lower ranch property, horseshoes, hiking and biking. Each employee has the opportunity to have a complimentary 1.5 hour horseback ride and (2) ½ day white water raft trips on the Salmon River. Many employees in the past have enjoyed camping and backpacking on their days off. \r\n\r\nThere is boundless opportunity for hiking, biking, fishing, climbing, white water rafting and other water sports, ghost town visits, photography and scenic drives in the area. We are surrounded by more wilderness than anywhere in the lower 48 States. A bike or auto will assist you in exploring the area.\r\n\r\n<h4>Uniform, Dress & Grooming Standards</h4>\r\nFor most positions the “uniform” is an IRMR shirt or T shirt, which will be given, with either black dress slacks or black jeans. There are some shifts (kitchen and housekeeping) for which neat, clean jeans or knee-length shorts may be worn if approval is given. Four nights a week the evening waitstaff, guest services hosts and cooks may wear their own western wear. \r\n\r\nFootwear must cover the entire foot – no open toes or sandals – and socks must be worn at all times. Hiking boots are not appropriate for lodge work. Neat, clean oxfords, tennis or running shoes may be worn. Cowboy boots may be worn only on specialty night, such as Thursday’s and Saturday’s barbecue. Clogs are not appropriate for meal service and floor positions. \r\n\r\nWe understand that “big and baggy” or “short, cropped and tight” could be current styles. However, these are not acceptable looks for your uniform slacks, shorts and shirts. We expect a neat, tidy, professional appearance, with hair property combed and in place, and beards conservatively groomed.  Dreadlocks, facial piercing, harsh hair and make-up colors, and other stylish, not-conservative, fashion statements are not appropriate to the professionalism projected here at the ranch. \r\n\r\nEmployees are expected to be neat and tidy in appearance at all times in the lodge and when in public areas on the ranch, even during off work hours. \r\n\r\n<h4>Additional Information</h4>\r\nIRMR is a smoke free environment.  If you smoke, you must do so in designated outside areas. \r\n\r\nQuiet hour on the ranch, for guests and employees, is at 10:30pm. \r\n\r\n<h4>Zero Tolerance Policy</h4>\r\nThere is a zero tolerance policy for the use of alcohol while on duty.  There also is a zero tolerance policy for theft, and for possession or use of drugs at any time, on the Ranch property.  Moderate alcohol use by those of legal age, while off duty, that does not interfere with others, violate proper decorum, or create a safety issue is permissible.  Zero tolerance means that violation of this policy will lead to dismissal. \r\n\r\n<strong>For additional information, please contact:</strong>\r\nErica Cole, Office Manager\r\nHC 64 Box 9934\r\nStanley, ID  83278\r\n208-774-3544\r\ninfo@idahorocky.com\r\nwww.idahorocky.com\r\n', 'Employment Information', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'employment-information', '', '', '2015-03-31 22:27:35', '2015-03-31 22:27:35', '', '510', 'http://irmr.zendentest.com/?page_id=572', '0', 'page', '', '0');

For employees choosing to live off campus, $5 per day for shift meal/s will be charged on days worked. Room and board is a combined package; there is not a separate package for room or board.  Please see above for available on-campus room and board.\n\nThe Housing provided with the room and board package is in dormitory style accommodations. A few private rooms are available, with most rooms shared by 2 or 3 people. You must provide your own bedding, towels and personal necessities.\n\nThere is a washer and dryer available free of charge for employees living on the ranch.\n\nA crew breakfast buffet is set up in the kitchen and a hot breakfast also may be ordered. Lunch generally is a make-your-own sandwich or other buffet. Crew dinner is served 7 nights a week between 5:00 – 5:45pm. There is a refrigerator for crew use that often has tasty leftovers designated for you.\n\nIf you will be camping on your days off, the chef will let you know the food available to pack and take with you. \n\nWe do our best to provide all employees with nutritious meals. For those employees on special diets, there will be food to accommodate your needs each meal. Please note:  The Ranch does not offer a custom-meal kitchen for employees or guests. There is limited space available in the crew refrigerator for food purchased for your personal use. \n\n<h4>Location, Climate & Transportation</h4>\nOur 900 acre ranch is located in the heart of the Sawtooth National Recreation Area, 9 miles south of Stanley on Highway 75 between mile markers 180 and 181. The ranch is 50 miles north of Sun Valley, 130 miles east of Boise and 125 miles north of Twin Falls, Idaho.\n\nStanley is a small town where you may purchase most necessities. Challis or Ketchum/Sun Valley, which are an hour to an hour and a half drive from the ranch, are the closest larger shopping areas.\n\nThe altitude here at the ranch is 6,600 feet. We can have lovely, hot summer days into the 80s in August, but on average have only 30 frost-free nights a year. Please be prepared for cold mornings and evenings, as well as our warmer days. \n\nThere is no public transportation to or within Stanley and the Sawtooth National Recreation Area.  The closest airport is Sun Valley; the closest major airport is Boise. Sun Valley Express (www.sunvalleyexpress.com) has daily service from the Boise airport to various locations in Ketchum/Sun Valley, from which we can assist with transportation. \n\nWe strongly recommend that you have some form of transportation – auto or bicycle – so that you may fully enjoy the area. \n\n<h4>Recreational Opportunities</h4>\nOn the ranch you may enjoy the ranch’s natural hot springs swimming pool, stocked catch-and-release fishing pond with paddleboat, the Salmon River running through the lower ranch property, horseshoes, hiking and biking. Each employee has the opportunity to have a complimentary 1.5 hour horseback ride and (2) ½ day white water raft trips on the Salmon River. Many employees in the past have enjoyed camping and backpacking on their days off. \n\nThere is boundless opportunity for hiking, biking, fishing, climbing, white water rafting and other water sports, ghost town visits, photography and scenic drives in the area. We are surrounded by more wilderness than anywhere in the lower 48 States. A bike or auto will assist you in exploring the area.\n\n<h4>Uniform, Dress & Grooming Standards</h4>\nFor most positions the “uniform” is an IRMR shirt or T shirt, which will be given, with either black dress slacks or black jeans. There are some shifts (kitchen and housekeeping) for which neat, clean jeans or knee-length shorts may be worn if approval is given. Four nights a week the evening waitstaff, guest services hosts and cooks may wear their own western wear. \n\nFootwear must cover the entire foot – no open toes or sandals – and socks must be worn at all times. Hiking boots are not appropriate for lodge work. Neat, clean oxfords, tennis or running shoes may be worn. Cowboy boots may be worn only on specialty night, such as Thursday’s and Saturday’s barbecue. Clogs are not appropriate for meal service and floor positions. \n\nWe understand that “big and baggy” or “short, cropped and tight” could be current styles. However, these are not acceptable looks for your uniform slacks, shorts and shirts. We expect a neat, tidy, professional appearance, with hair property combed and in place, and beards conservatively groomed.  Dreadlocks, facial piercing, harsh hair and make-up colors, and other stylish, not-conservative, fashion statements are not appropriate to the professionalism projected here at the ranch. \n\nEmployees are expected to be neat and tidy in appearance at all times in the lodge and when in public areas on the ranch, even during off work hours. \n\n<h4>Additional Information</h4>\nIRMR is a smoke free environment.  If you smoke, you must do so in designated outside areas. \n\nQuiet hour on the ranch, for guests and employees, is at 10:30pm. \n\n<h4>Zero Tolerance Policy</h4>\nThere is a zero tolerance policy for the use of alcohol while on duty.  There also is a zero tolerance policy for theft, and for possession or use of drugs at any time, on the Ranch property.  Moderate alcohol use by those of legal age, while off duty, that does not interfere with others, violate proper decorum, or create a safety issue is permissible.  Zero tolerance means that violation of this policy will lead to dismissal. \n\nFor additional information, please contact:\nErica Cole, Office Manager\nHC 64 Box 9934\nStanley, ID  83278\n208-774-3544\ninfo@idahorocky.com\nwww.idahorocky.com\n', 'Employment Information', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '572-autosave-v1', '', '', '2015-03-31 22:25:58', '2015-03-31 22:25:58', '', '572', 'http://irmr.zendentest.com/572-autosave-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');
