There is a plethora of high mountain or valley lakes accessible by vehicle or foot, with days where no other angler drops even a single line. If your preference is to get off the beaten path, there are hundreds of small streams feeding the Salmon River to explore.\r\n\r\nThe Salmon River and headwaters of the Middle Ford are home to the west slope cutthroat – all eager to take a dry fly. The river also holds rainbow trout, brook trout, bull trout, and mountain whitefish. The valley and high alpine lakes hold west slope cutthroat, rainbow and brook trout. Stop by McCoy’s Tackle Shop nine miles down the road in Stanley, and the nice folks there will talk flies and what’s fishing, all day if you please.\r\n<h4>Fishing Gear &amp; Instruction</h4>\r\nAs a guest of the ranch you have the opportunity to fish our private stocked pond for rainbow or brook trout, or fish the Salmon River which runs through our property. We have gear available for the kids for on-Ranch fishing, and local fishing shops have equipment for rent or sale.\r\n\r\nWhether you need incentive to get started, or are a long-time passionate angler, we offer weekly fishing activities to encourage, instruct and enthuse. A weekly casting clinic with Mary Ann Dozer, Silver Creek Outfitters, and “Let’s Talk Fishing” on the porch one evening a week with Mary Ann and Dave Dozer are complimentary and open to all.

Using local organic, sustainable products whenever possible --rainbow carrots and turnip greens, morel mushrooms, lava lake lamb,local squash blossom -- Ranch food is made in-house of the highest quality fresh ingredients.

His sensibilities arise from a mix of fine culinary and wine training, and his rugged upbringing in Gig Harbor, WA. Since he could walk, Jordan has been a tried and true outdoor enthusiast, with a love of backcountry skiing, golf and wakeboarding. When not up to his elbows applying a meat rub or preparing a Kecap Manis-Lime Glaze in the  Ranch kitchen, you’ll find him out exploring the magnificent Sawtooth Mountains with his beautiful wife, Stephanie and daughter, Olivia (favorite food: mac & cheese) and black lab, Jake. Jordan developed a love of cooking learning from his grandmother. He earned his food and wine degrees from the Art Institute of Colorado, Denver, in 2003. Jordan helped open the Ranch at Rock Creek in Philipsburg, MT and was Executive Chef at the famed Mint Bar and Café in Bozeman, MT for four years.\r\n', 'Meet Our Chef', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'meet-our-chef', '', '', '2015-03-23 18:49:53', '2015-03-23 18:49:53', '', '81', 'http://irmr.zendentest.com/?page_id=83', '0', 'page', '', '0');

The SNRA encompasses the Sawtooth Wilderness, Sawtooth Mountains, backcountry of the White Cloud Mountains, portions of the Boulder and Smoky Mountains, as well as the headwaters of the Salmon, Payette, Boise and Big Wood Rivers.  It’s further surrounded by the Frank Church Wilderness and Salmon-Challis and Boise National Forests.\r\n\r\nWith this vast playground background, you’re free to venture forth and enjoy:  Scenic, uncrowded trails for hiking, horseback riding and mountain biking; climbing in pristine country; fishing in lakes, streams and rivers; white water rafting, scenic river floats, canoeing and other water sports; and, of course Instagram-worthy photo opps galore!\r\n\r\nThree scenic byways leading through the region allow you also to explore memorable sites in Idaho’s Rockies by car - as a day trip from the Ranch, as you travel for your visit, or en route to a shopping day in nearby Sun Valley. \r\n\r\nI’d like to reserve option to NOT use the video and its introductory sentence, per below.

Closer to the Ranch Sawtooth City and Vienna, though unrestored, stand as similar testament.\r\nIf you venture further on the old stagecoach road, The Custer Motorway Adventure Road, to Challis, be sure to stop at the Land of the Yankee Fork Interpretive Center and Bayhorse on your way back to the Ranch.\r\nScenic Drives\r\nEven the shortest drive provides incomparable views and photo opportunities, but there are several we highly recommend if you choose to road-trip in the Valley. Basin Butte Lookout, Cape Horn Guard Station Loop, the Dagger Falls-Decker Flat Road (FS Road 210), a trip to Galena Summit and the Headwaters of the Salmon River, Kelly Creek Road, Nip and Tuck Road, Pole Creek Lookout, and Valley Road all provide magnificent scenery, and a chance to view local wildlife.  There also are three designated scenic byways through the valley:  the Ponderosa Pine, Salmon River and Sawtooth.\r\nWalking Tours\r\nIn addition to a stroll through Stanley, a walk though Sun Valley, Ketchum, Hailey and Challis provides more history – and shopping.  And while in Sun Valley, a visit to the outdoor ice skating rink, for watching or skating, provides a novel summer pleasure.\r\n \r\nLINK to the Area Recreation and Exploration doc, posted on basecamp, files, title Area Recreation and Exploration\r\n', 'Area Attractions', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '57-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-03-23 18:46:39', '2015-03-23 18:46:39', '', '57', 'http://irmr.zendentest.com/57-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

His sensibilities arise from a mix of fine culinary and wine training, and his rugged upbringing in Gig Harbor, WA. Since he could walk, Jordan has been a tried and true outdoor enthusiast, with a love of backcountry skiing, golf and wakeboarding. When not up to his elbows applying a meat rub or preparing a Kecap Manis-Lime Glaze in the  Ranch kitchen, you’ll find him out exploring the magnificent Sawtooth Mountains with his beautiful wife, Stephanie and daughter, Olivia (favorite food: mac & cheese) and black lab, Jake. Jordan developed a love of cooking learning from his grandmother. He earned his food and wine degrees from the Art Institute of Colorado, Denver, in 2003. Jordan helped open the Ranch at Rock Creek in Philipsburg, MT and was Executive Chef at the famed Mint Bar and Café in Bozeman, MT for four years.\r\n', 'Meet Our Chef', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '83-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-03-23 18:49:53', '2015-03-23 18:49:53', '', '83', 'http://irmr.zendentest.com/83-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

And of course, the iconic 18- mile Fisher Creek-Williams Creek Trail, replete with single track, heart-stopping thrills, beckons hard core mountain bikers.\r\n\r\n<h4>Gear</h4>\r\nThe Ranch provides 10 Specialized Rockhopper (26”tire size) and Specialized Crave (29” tire size) mountain bikes ranging in size from adult small to extra large. The Specialized Crave bikes are built with the newer 29” tire geometry. The Specialized Rockhoppers are tried and true with 26” tires, and are better suited to the smaller rider.   Most bikes have disc brakes, front shocks, platform pedals and come equipped with pump, spare tire tube and repair kit. We also have a wide selection of helmets. Bikes for small children are not available.\r\n\r\n<h4>Lessons</h4>\r\nTo get you started, we offer two complimentary weekly bike clinics with an on-ranch initiation ride. \r\n\r\n<i class=\"fa fa-file-pdf-o\"></i>  <a href=\"http://irmr.zendentest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/mountain-biking-trails.pdf\">Mountain Biking Trails List</a>\r\n<img src=\"http://irmr.zendentest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/mountain-biking.jpg\" alt=\"Idaho Rocky Mountain Ranch Biking\"  class=\"floatimg\" />\r\n', 'Mountain Biking', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '45-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-03-23 23:10:09', '2015-03-23 23:10:09', '', '45', 'http://irmr.zendentest.com/45-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

Basin Butte Lookout, Cape Horn Guard Station Loop, the Dagger Falls-Decker Flat Road (FS Road 210), a trip to Galena Summit and the Headwaters of the Salmon River, Kelly Creek Road, Nip and Tuck Road, Pole Creek Lookout, and Valley Road all provide magnificent scenery, and a chance to view local wildlife.  There also are three designated scenic byways through the valley:  the Ponderosa Pine, Salmon River and Sawtooth.\r\n\r\n<h4>Walking Tours</h4>\r\nIn addition to a stroll through Stanley, a walk though Sun Valley, Ketchum, Hailey and Challis provides more history – and shopping.
